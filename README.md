# LoanHelper
A tool for simulating loans to help with future financial decisions.


## Calculators
There are currently two calculators: Payment and Period.

### Payment Calculator
The Payment Calculator allows you to estimate the payment of a loan based on its principal value, interest rate, and number of periods (number of payments to be made).

### Period Calculator
The Period Calculator allows you to estimate the number of periods that would be required to pay off a loan with a given payment amount. Given the principal value, interest rate, and the desired payment, you can determine how long it should take you to pay off the loan (rounding up).
